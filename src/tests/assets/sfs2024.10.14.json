       "description": "<p>The adoption of the CRA (Cyber Resilience Act) has caused some real anxiety among the FOSS ecosystem. Even in its amended form, many questions remain opened and debated, and more to the point, a lot of uncertainty still surrounds it, not just at the level of its general architecture but also at the implementation level.<br />\nIt is perhaps fair to mention that the CRA itself does not exist in a void and is building on already existing regulations and ideas. However, it should be explained how the CRA itself was not born inside the institutions of the European Union but is an almost pure product of governmental cyber security circles and agencies. Because of that, the digital ecosystem at large is at pain understanding some of its logic. This talk will start with what we know and what we can infer from the CRA, and how it fits within the general regulatory framework of the European Union. We will thus clarify the following points:</p>\n<p>&#8211; what does the CRA mean in terms of software security assessment and certification &#8211; and how that plays a key role in understanding what the CRA is and what it is not<br />\n&#8211; CRA within the European regulatory framework<br />\n&#8211; CRA implementation: the bad, the ugly, and the unknown</p>\n<p>We will then discuss what the concerns are for the FOSS communities. Most notably:</p>\n<p>&#8211; barriers of entry for Free Software companies, esp. the small and medium ones<br />\n&#8211; legal inability to develop Free and Open Source Software<br />\n&#8211; what will Free and Open Source software foundations do in edge cases and what are they expected to bring in terms of guidance to the companies contributing to their projects</p>\n<p>It will then discuss how we can best prepare for it, and make some suggestions on how to solve FOSS specific challenges related to CRA. In particular the talk will explore the following possibilities:</p>\n<p>&#8211; evolving the role or cross project security teams<br />\n-promoting best practices in development (CI CD, code auditability) turning the CRA against proprietary software practices<br />\n&#8211; Pooling security audits<br />\n&#8211; Better release management</p>\n<p>Last but not least, this talk will discuss the economics behind the CRA and why this may not end up being less of a problem than we think.</p>",

       "description": "<p>The rapid evolution of autonomous systems is leading to the formation of Autonomous Ecosystems, complex networks of machines with their own governance challenges. A good example of such ecosystem could be a city with Autonomous Vehicles. A key issue in these ecosystems is to ensure that machines behave fairly towards each other. This talk proposes a novel interdisciplinary approach by utilizing blockchain technology to monetize fairness. By creating fairness tokens, the fair behavior of machines becomes a quantifiable, incentivized metric. Fair behavior can be rewarded with these tokens, which can also be used to purchase fairness within the ecosystem. This approach not only encourages equitable machine interactions but also offers a self-regulating mechanism for the maintenance and governance of these ecosystems.</p>",

That means we can potentially run any software we want to make full use of the hardware. This potential is fostered by Free Software.</p>\n<p>However, device manufacturers, vendors, and internet platforms have been restricting software freedom by exercising their monopolistic control over end-user equipment. This power is used over key features and components of devices such as operating systems, browsers, and app stores.</p>\n<p>Basic freedoms such as installing and uninstalling software are being unfairly limited by these companies, commonly referred to as &#8220;gatekeepers&#8221;, because of their monopolistic control over devices.</p>\n<p>As a concrete example, this talk will present the policy and legal work of FSFE in denouncing the detrimental commercial practices of a worldwide known gatekeeper: Apple.</p>\n<p>Apple&#8217;s monopolistic power over its devices is detrimental to Free Software and a high risk for the right of general purpose computers.

In early 2000, I did my first “CCS check” (complete, corresponding sourcecode check) — wherein one attempts to build the “CCS candidate” provided by the vendor to investigate whether the CCS candidate is actually complete, and whether it corresponds to the binaries that were distributed.</p>\n<p>In those days, violations of copyleft licenses were rare, and once uncovered, companies eventually corrected their behavior. Yet, even then, it took years of work to convince the company to comply. And often, by the time compliance was achieved, a new generation of the product was released.</p>\n<p>25 years later, we face the same problems with nearly every vendor.<br />\nAlmost every product on the market today contains Linux, BusyBox, the GNU C Library, GNU Bash, and dozen other packages licensed under the GPL and/or LGPL. Almost none of these companies, even if an offer for source code is made, provide CCS.</p>\n<p>This talk will look both to the past and future as we investigate software rights and freedoms of the average consumer, and how we reached this difficult situation.

Most of these efforts seem to, explicitly or implicitly, have a certain use case in mind.</p>\n<p>This project sets out to:<br />\nConsider provisioning case &#8211; how is the software provided to your user (e.g. binary distribution, SaaS, Web UI)<br />\nConsider use case &#8211; how is the software used (e.g. compiler, library)<br />\nTrust model &#8211; why should you trust the contributor of a classification or you should be able to exclude a contributor’s work etc<br />\nIdentify and generalize FOSS license clauses<br />\nIdentify and generalize when a clauses is triggered<br />\nDetermine how clauses are compatible with each other (a license clause matrix)<br />\nIdentify the clauses and triggers for each license</p>\n<p>Keeping track of how 100 licenses are compatible with each other will result in a matrix with 10 000 (100 x 100) values. This is hard to maintain. Extending to 200 licenses requires 40 000 values. By instead looking at the license clauses we will end up with a much smaller problem, assuming we identify 20-30 of them, which will result in a matrix of 400-900 values. This is big, but maintainable. Adding a new license will not increase the size of the (license clause) matrix, which means that our approach scales much better. From the license definitions and license clause matrix we can compile a license compatibility matrix (for fast compatibility lookup).</p>\n<p>This project sets out to provide to users:<br />\nA license obligation checklist for each provisioning case &#8211; for making compliance checks easy<br />\nA license compatibility matrix for each provisioning case &#8211; for fast compatibility lookup</p>\n<p>All data and source code will be released under FOSS licenses.</p>",

Use cases may be the integration of widgets with rich text documents, including classic desktop macros, into browser based applications or enabling JavaScript to interact live with values in spreadsheets.

Museums, as custodians of cultural and historical artefacts, can benefit substantially from this transformation. Open Access and FOSS can greatly increase the potential of museums for public outreach: enhance their educational impact and inspire new forms of cultural engagement and knowledge discovery. For example, by digitising collections and enabling Open Access for diverse audiences, accessibility barriers are eliminated and thousands of hidden treasures become available to both researchers and the wider public. Additionally, innovative data visualisations via FOSS platforms can reveal compelling insights into object collections and the research associated with them; Open Access can thus make complex research accessible and engaging to a broader audience. Through such practices, museums can democratise their activities and enrich the visitor experience. The process is not without obstacles; common challenges museums face in adopting Open Access policies are copyright issues, data privacy, and resource limitations.</p>\n<p>The presentation will discuss the aforementioned opportunities and issues currently emerging in the museum sector. The talk will be illustrated with examples from the Deutsches Museum in Munich, the world’s largest museum of science and technology.</p>",

It is a framework developed for NGI Trustchain Project within a broader Next Generation Internet scheme of the EU in order to address a lack of decentralization in consent management regarding users’ sharing of their data. The aim of DOOF is to revolutionize personal data governance and normalise the deployment of consent management and privacy enhancing technologies. It uniquely enables individuals to control their rights over data sharing, fostering greater trust and regulatory compliance, essential for building a resilient and transparent data economy.<br />\nDOOF targets the gap in current centralized consent management, where GDPR and Data Act demand seamless data exchange and regulatory compliance. Yet the sharing and consent management regarding users’ data is centralized &#8211; a responsibility of the data intermediary &#8211; which comes with great costs and liabilities.<br />\nWith DOOF, Ecosteer aims to separate and decouple the layer of physical data transferring from the layer of consent management. DOOF offers companies a framework that allows them to easily adopt Privacy Enhancing Technologies (PETs) for the actual sharing of data and enforcement of users’ decisions.<br />\nThe framework consists of a set of SDKs, libraries and a Smart Contract for decentralised consent management. The main component of the framework is a worker pipeline, consisting of extensible, plug-in processors. This pipeline contributes to the low-code movement, offering a framework that can be easily adapted to different business needs. Companies can easily build verticals on this existing framework by just extending some of its functionalities.<br />\nThis talk will focus on the concept of decentralized consent management as well as pipeline-based orchestration framework, outlining the process of creating a novel, re-usable and extensible open-source project.</p>",

       "description": "<p>Sensor Things API (STA, in short), is an OGC specification for storing and retrieving (timeseries of) Sensor Observations.</p>\n<p>FROST-Server, developed by Fraunhofer IOSB, is one of the most consolidated implementations of STA with a very detailed documentation and a lot of background information. The implementation includes a REST endpoint to insert, modify and retrieve STA entities with a query language based on OASIS Odata URL patterns and query options.</p>\n<p>A QGIS experimental plugin, developed by Deda Next srl in 2022 and implemented in python within the EU project Air-Break, is currently available to connect to STA-compliant endpoints and retrieve sensor data (e.g. European Air Quality data from this endpoint). The plugin has an embedded data provider which is currently designed to retrieve sensors&#8217; locations as geometrical features and then request the time series of observations for specific locations.</p>\n<p>However, in order to offer support to a wider range of use cases and more complex queries on STA model entities, Faunalia and DedaNext (funded by BRGM) started to plan for a dedicated STA data provider for GIS: a development group was set up involving the QGIS community, formal acceptance of the proposal was sought within the QGIS community (QEP #257) and possible development options for the provider (ex: python vs C++) were analyzed. As STA is an OGC standard, it seemed appropriate to implement it in C++ as a core element of QGIS.</p>\n<p>Development has therefore been carried out in close interaction with the QGIS developer community with the focus on supporting complex STA queries, implementing among other things:</p>\n<p>&#8211; expansion of relations among model entities;<br />\n&#8211; independent attribute filtering and sorting on all entities;<br />\n&#8211; efficient data caching to limit unnecessary data transfers;</p>\n<p>This new core element is available from QGIS version 3.37 (currently only available as nightly release).</p>\n<p>Finally, plans are underway to develop a new version of the QGIS STA plugin (originally developed by Deda Next within project AirBreak) focused on data exploration and analysis that will be able to leverage on the newly released core STA data provider to support a wider range of use cases, such as:</p>\n<p>&#8211; Time series analysis: This is the case of the old STA plugin. Fetch Locations, show them on the map. Then, upon selection of one location, fetch all related Things and Datastreams, and finally, fetch the Observations of the desired Datastream to be shown in a table or plot;<br />\n&#8211; Space-time series analysis: Given a selected set of Datastreams from a moving sensor, get all the FeaturesOfInterest of those Datastreams and plot them on the map, so to have a view of the path of the moving sensor and a hold on its values on every part of that path;<br />\n&#8211; Monitoring and inspection: Fetch all the latest observations of all Datastreams (or a selection based on the ObservedProperty) and show these at their Locations, styled by the result of the latest Observation of a given ObservedProperty. Then, in a second phase (eg. if a value is over a threshold), inspect the full timeseries of that one Datastream.<br />\n&#8211; Tracking of moving things: Show all Things with their current Location and their HistoricalLocations with the Temporal Controller (time slider).</p>",

Leveraging the strengths of open-source technologies, the application provides a robust platform for researchers, policymakers, and the public to access and understand the complexities of multi-hazard scenarios. The main parts of this web application is explained in the following paragraphs:</p>\n<p>(i) The core of the application is built with Django, a high-level Python web framework known for its rapid development capabilities and clean, pragmatic design. PostgreSQL, a powerful and scalable open-source relational database system, ensures efficient data storage and management. Together, these technologies offer a reliable and flexible foundation for handling diverse and large datasets.</p>\n<p>(ii) To visualize the events, Leaflet Map which is an open source contributor to the OpenStreet Map has been used.</p>\n<p>(iii) To populate the database, the application exploits various RESTful APIs, integrating data from multiple sources, including satellite imagery, climatological records, in-situ measurements, and relevant statistical data. This multi-source approach allows for a comprehensive characterization of risks, exposures, and susceptibilities associated with multi-hazard events benefiting from the Open Data Standards such as OGC Standard.</p>\n<p>(iiii)Key features of the application include spatial and temporal filtering of events, cross-linking of data sets for enhanced reusability, and compliance with open standards such as RESTful APIs and OGC standards. The platform is designed to be expandable, with the potential to incorporate additional locations and datasets in the future.</p>\n<p>By providing an accessible online platform, this web application aims to support the understanding and analysis of multi-hazard events, facilitating informed decision-making and effective disaster management strategies. The use of open-source technologies and the integration of diverse data sources underscore the project&#8217;s commitment to innovation, scalability, and community-driven development.</p>",

       "description": "<p>The project has its roots in a precise and simplified cartographic updating methodology introduced by the Consortium of Municipalities of the Province of Bolzano in the early 2000s. This methodology, which was consolidated over the years, could no longer be applied following the adoption of the Territorial Data Catalogue (Ministerial Decree 10.11.2011 &#8220;Technical rules for defining the content specifications of geotopographic databases&#8221; and subsequent amendments) due to the complexity and articulation of the new national model. The primary objective of the project was to research and define a minimum set of information that could adequately describe the territory within the typical use context of the public administration, ensuring its sustainability in terms of the ability to keep it updated and aligned with the transformations of the territory. Simplifying the definition and understanding of the basic technical layer that every public administration producing geographic data must guarantee within their institutional activities for geotopographic databases is a fundamental step to adequately support territorial management. Lightened of the informational content already managed by the Provincial Administration within archives or sectoral Information Systems, and consequently already included in existing and consolidated maintenance and updating flows, as well as everything that can be considered three-dimensional data nowadays obtainable through faster and more accurate systems, the Basic Core (BC) specification was produced by reorganizing and simplifying the information levels contained in the National Territorial Data Catalogue with reference to the identified minimum subset of required information known as the National Core (NC). To make it practically usable, only the themes considered objectively useful and easily updatable were included in the Basic Core. Our presentation will outline the key points that enabled the design of the Basic Core content specification and illustrates the technological tools developed, as well as the automatic transformation and simplification procedures that led to the significant reduction in the number of object classes provided by the National Core (from 59 to only 23), demonstrating that the Basic Core project is not a merely theoretical exercise, but a practical and concrete application currently tested and successfully used in South Tyrol. The specifically developed Dashboard for managing, correcting and updating the provincial Geotopographic Database, built on the basis of this new simplified specification, will be explained in detail. This dashboard allows effective operation on every management aspect, including the crucial task of sharing maintenance responsibilities between the Provincial and Municipal levels, thus ensuring the full efficiency of this fundamental geographic base. Particular attention will be given to illustrating the guided editing functionality available directly from the online interface, as well as the options for creating and exporting QGIS projects. QGIS projects are designed to perform the most significant and advanced corrections and/or updates. We will conclude the overview of this innovative system with a demonstration of the processes for reimporting and validating the updated data. Finally, practical cases in which the Basic Core has been used will be presented, as well as future developments, already planned and those still under evaluation, that the system will receive in order to refine and make its use more robust.</p>",

While the &#8220;why&#8221; is clear and quite declared by many, the &#8220;what&#8221; to do and the &#8220;how&#8221; to do it remain very nebulous and, in some cases, obscure. Those ones who lead innovation within an organization suffer the innovation paradox: must innovate without knowing what and how. Innovators and pioneers are often alone, without a framework and processes for an open innovation execution. How can we unlock and unleash innovation, ensuring that the actions taken are always driven by what is truly needed to evolve your organization?</p>",

I designed this three years experimental project together with the <a href=\"https://freesoftwarelab.noi.bz.it/\">Free Software Lab</a> of NOI Techpark with the value proposition of (re)designing the FSFE Italian Community.</p>\n<p>The project followed a human centric approach, moving along the five core stages of design-thinking. The goal of my talk is to describe the FSFE Italy project and the design-thinking approach adopted.</p>\n<p>The first year (Y1) served as the understanding phase: I got involved as an FSFE representative in the main communication channels used by the Free Software (FS) community on the territory. I conducted interviews with volunteers, associations’ heads and enthusiasts, took part into the main FS events organized on the territory, mapped all stakeholders (understanding-observing) and created my own point of view (POV). By the end of 2022 I had already became an established FSFE representative on the territory, having gathered inputs and ideas on how to kick off the community into year two (Y2). The goal of year two was to build on these new ideas (ideation) and put these thoughts into action (prototyping) by finding common goals and activities with the main FS associations active on the territory and signing Memorandum of Understandings, preparing the ground to test it in the third year (Y3). Guess what was the result?</p>",

The culture of &#8220;fitting in&#8221; and &#8220;going along&#8221; suppresses new ideas and critical perspectives. Drawing on my decade of community management experience, I will share how to eliminate fear and aggression, fostering psychological safety where creativity can thrive.</p>\n<p>Creating a sense of community is essential. When people feel welcomed, they are more likely to stay and contribute. Inclusivity is key to building a positive atmosphere. By making everyone feel valued, we can encourage collaboration and idea-sharing.</p>\n<p>We must move beyond the &#8220;Read the Manual&#8221; culture and establish a “No Stupid Questions” rule. This embraces curiosity and eliminates the stigma of asking questions, especially for newcomers. When people feel safe to ask questions without fear, they engage more deeply and contribute meaningfully.</p>\n<p>Creating a safe space for expression involves fostering a culture where it&#8217;s okay to share half-finished thoughts, ask unconventional questions, and admit mistakes without fear. When members feel they can be open, they are more likely to share innovative ideas.</p>\n<p>Constructive dissent is crucial for innovation. Encouraging respectful disagreement and valuing different perspectives drives the community forward and prevents stagnation.</p>\n<p>Avoiding the &#8220;ivory tower effect&#8221; is also important. Promoting transparency in the development process by openly communicating project goals, decisions, and challenges helps build trust and encourages participation.</p>\n<p>This session will provide practical insights and strategies to transform your open source community into a fearless hub of innovation. Together, we can create a culture where expressing ideas, asking questions, and admitting mistakes are safe, fostering an environment where creativity can flourish.</p>",

       "description": "<p>In Finnish upper secondary schools course and final exams have been digital for some years now. Ordinary student laptops are routinely booted from USB flash drives to a special operating system, which provides a restricted environment allowing students to take an exam with no distractions or tools to cheat. Up to these days, this was implemented with Debian GNU/Linux, also meaning that student laptops must be Linux-compatible.</p>\n<p>This is now changing. Not every modern laptop can simply boot from a USB drive to run Linux, these including chromebooks, Apple laptops and some new Windows laptops. Some schools may want to buy these devices and do not want a separate set of computers only for examinations. The current system is being replaced by an exam application, meant to run on different operating systems, which are to provide guarantees that no cheating can occur. The exam application activates the &#8220;assessment mode&#8221;, provided by operating system vendors, and this mode should provide a safe place where no cheating can occur, even on computers owned by the students.</p>\n<p>Does that even make sense? Can that really be done, and with free software? In this presentation we take a peek at some technologies in Linux systems that can be used to secure a computer against an attacker with a physical access to the machine. We will also look at possible ways to implement an &#8220;assessment mode&#8221; in Linux desktops.</p>",

Without software we couldn&#8217;t write e-mails, make phone calls, go shopping, or travel as we are accustomed to. Software is our society&#8217;s central tool. How do we ensure that the next generation is motivated and capable of shaping technology for society&#8217;s benefits?</p>\n<p>The Free Software Foundation Europe&#8217;s volunteers and staff have interacted with over 1700 children between 6 to 10 years in the past months. Children, especially girls, afterwards were motivated to start experimenting with hardware and software. In the discussions we saw that they realise how crucial technology will be for them.

They may contain unwanted or malicious features and, most importantly, they do not encourage reuse, nor do they allow it. The two main causes of such secrecy are: 1. standard design tools explicitly forbid the publication of any output, and 2. most foundries disallow disclosing technology details. Designers moreover face additional problems: The licence cost of standard design tools is unaffordable for most SMEs (unless questionable discount policies are applied), and lock-in threats arise at many levels, from IP blocks to foundry details to file formats. Yet exceptional progress has been made in recent years: Hundreds of silicon chips have been designed using free and open-source tools, and three foundries have made details of their processes public: The doors to free silicon are open! Hence how is politics reacting? What are the next steps to be taken? What are the opportunities for users, society and companies?</p>",

We aim to change that by reaching out directly to eco-consumers in the &#8220;Opt Green&#8221; project, a new KDE Eco initiative funded by the German Environmental Agency.</p>\n<p>Consumers want sustainable software: in a recent European poll 50% of respondents say the two primary reasons they purchase a new device are non-functioning software and software performance issues. This is as good a time as ever for an &#8220;Opt Green&#8221; message. In the next couple of years Windows 10 end-of-life and the phasing out of Intel-based macOS support will make e-waste out of hundreds of millions of computers. Functioning but vendor-abandoned devices can stay out of the landfill and in use for many years to come. With software designed for users&#8217; needs, not vendors&#8217;, it is possible to run software on the devices one already owns. Lean, efficient Free Software even runs on devices that are decades old. This is good for users, and better for the environment!</p>\n<p>In this lightning talk I will provide an overview of the whys and hows of KDE Eco&#8217;s &#8220;Opt Green&#8221; initiative. Through campaigns and workshops over the next 2 years, we will raise awareness about environmental issues driven by software and demonstrate the power of Free Software to drive down resource use and keep devices running smoothly for years beyond official vendor support. This is all possible because Free Software *is* right-to-repair software: it removes vendor dependencies and guarantees transparency and user autonomy, providing full control over software, and thus hardware. I will describe the ways we plan to reach our target audience, including materials designed for eco-consumers and events well outside usual tech circles, such as open-air organic, artisanal, and fair trade markets, cultural centers, and others. These activities give us the opportunity to align our values in the Free Software community with those in allied communities striving for a sustainable modern lifestyle.</p>",

       "description": "<p>In this presentation, we introduce ClapMetrics &#8211; an innovative and seamless method for deducing the gender and age of smartwatch users. This system ingeniously harnesses the capabilities of the smartwatch’s integrated 3D sensors — specifically, the accelerometer and gyroscope—to capture the wearer’s arm movements during a clapping action. ClapMetrics operates on the principle that each clap is a complex interplay of motion, unique to the individual, much like a fingerprint. By analyzing these movements, ClapMetrics can gather rich biometric data without any active input or effort from the user, making it a remarkably non-intrusive technology. We will delve into the specifics of how ClapMetrics processes sensor data to make its estimations. We will explore the Neural Network’s architecture, the training process, and how the model interprets the sensor data to make reliable predictions about the wearer’s gender and age.</p>",

       "description": "<p>Open Hardware (OH) is revolutionizing the way we approach technology in several areas, such as agriculture and healthcare. These areas, which are fundamental to food availability and human well-being, are undergoing an important shift as open hardware licensing strategies, inspired by open-source software (OSS), make solutions more accessible, affordable, and customizable. In this talk, we review major factors determining the use and adoption of OH technologies, including economic advantages, opportunities, and challenges.<br />\nSimilar to OSS, OH applications are gaining momentum. In agriculture, farmers and researchers are turning to OH for precision farming tools, environmental monitoring, and robotics. These technologies not only reduce development costs but can be easily adapted to specific local needs, enhancing their effectiveness in diverse agricultural environments – crucial for small-scale farmers in developing countries and rural areas who face financial constraints. Likewise, the healthcare industry is benefiting from OH through the development of affordable medical devices, diagnostic tools, and treatment systems. The high costs and regulatory challenges associated with traditional medical devices often limit access to essential healthcare, especially in underdeveloped regions. Examples include open-source ventilators, syringe pumps, and diagnostic devices.<br />\nApplications of OH will be showcased through a comparative analysis of successful projects, particularly those with high engagement on platforms like GitHub, characterized by community engagement, active forums, and regular updates. Finally, we will draw conclusions about the potential of OH for industries beyond agriculture and healthcare, encouraging further innovation and collaboration in the open-source community.</p>",

Multiple solutions have been proposed with different results, but none of them has established a reference framework and a global adoption. One of the main reasons for this to stay as a key element for research and investment is the diversity among the whole technology stack and geographical dispersion of device manufacturers. In the last years, there is a solution that is capturing the attention by demonstrating how an open source operating system can enable global interoperability in a huge domestic market like China. This solution is OpenHarmony and through a cooperation with Eclipse Foundation Oniro project, it is intended to use open source to drive interoperability and therefore solve one of the biggest challenges in the IoT and smart device industry. During the talk, it will be presented the approach followed by these two independent initiatives to cooperate while keeping the independence of the open source communities behind them.</p>",

       "description": "<p>AURA project centers on the development of &#8220;Green &amp; Smart Urban Furniture,&#8221; a new generation of urban furniture that transcends traditional roles by incorporating eco-friendly and intelligent features. These urban elements are designed with bioabsorbent vegetation capable of mitigating atmospheric pollutants, making them environmentally sustainable. Furthermore, they are outfitted with advanced IoT sensors that monitor a range of environmental parameters, including climate data, urban pollution, and vehicular traffic.</p>\n<p>These smart urban furniture units not only establish an extensive urban monitoring network but also actively combat pollution through the sequestration and reduction of harmful substances via the integrated vegetation. The embedded IoT sensors provide innovative capabilities for tracking the impact of these elements on the surrounding urban environment, such as monitoring air pollution levels and assessing the effects of heat islands. Each furniture piece is equipped with a &#8220;smart box,&#8221; a hardware system constructed using low-cost commercial off-the-shelf (COTS) components. This system includes climate and environmental sensors, gas measurement devices, a processing unit, and a data transmission module. The accompanying software, developed from scratch, delivers localized information—such as CO2 sequestration, temperature, and humidity—and contributes to a comprehensive environmental monitoring network aimed at predictive analysis, including weather risks, heat wave alerts, and health risks associated with air pollution. The presentation will delve into the custom-developed software and its ability to meet the field-level requirements of the AURA Architecture, encompassing individual sensors, sensor nodes (smart-boxes within the furniture), and the broader network of these nodes. It will highlight the significant impact and benefits of utilizing free and open-source technologies throughout the development process. Key focus areas include the creation of drivers for individual sensors, with emphasis on the most representative examples, the development of software for sensor nodes—covering features like self-testing, over-the-air (OTA) updates, and MQTT communication—and the design of a dynamic web app for data presentation, leveraging JavaScript, Bootstrap, and a JSON Data Lake. This comprehensive approach underscores the importance of open technologies in accelerating innovation, ensuring flexibility, and delivering robust, scalable solutions for smart urban environments.</p>",

The first method uses parameters derived from image analysis tools, focusing on attributes such as shape, size, and color of objects, informed by preliminary tests and expert data. The machine learning method employs a sophisticated algorithm that dynamically learns and identifies objects in images. We used both approaches using diverse datasets and measured their accuracy and efficiency under various conditions. The aim of this presentation is to show the improvement obtained by using the AI-based system applied for real-time detection and classification, offering insights into their practical strengths and applications.</p>",

Open source software is susceptible to vulnerabilities just like any other software. Moreover, the fact that anyone can review the code does not guarantee that the right people will do so. Open source software faces two important threats than not everybody are aware of:</p>\n<p>Vulnerabilities: Open source developers need to understand and communicate the security posture of their projects to users. They must adopt robust security practices. The Log4j incident in 2021, which led to the Log4Shell vulnerability, triggered a catastrophic wave of attacks due to inadequate support for the logging framework and its critical role in company procedures.</p>\n<p>Dev teams infiltration: Criminal organizations and government hacking teams are executing highly sophisticated social engineering operations to infiltrate understaffed open source projects. Their goal is to compromise development teams and insert backdoors into the software. The most recent attack on a significant project was discovered in April 2024.</p>\n<p>Objective of the Talk: Inform the community about these two security scenarios and demonstrate how to effectively address them.</p>",

Software architects and developers welcome approaches, techniques, and patterns that can facilitate and automate the migration process. This talk will present Monolith Splitter, a tool that employs various approaches for splitting a monolith into a microservices architecture. This tool could be beneficial for software architects looking to migrate monolithic projects to a more scalable architecture. It uses execution traces to analyze monolithic software and suggests which classes should be grouped together in separate services according to criteria such as cohesion, modularity, and independence of evolvability. We will showcase the application of the tool to a series of open source software projects, discussing the outcomes, the benefits, and the current limitations.</p>",

In this talk, we&#8217;re navigating through new ideas on how to use metrics to tell us more than the basics about our microservices. Did you know we can evaluate our microservices in the architectural level? So we&#8217;ll have concrete data to support our decision-making. Between patterns and bad smells, we can use metrics to detect the points where they happen. Let&#8217;s explore these new possibilities to improve our experience when evolving a microservice system, towards a more robust and maintainable direction! Bonus: you&#8217;ll learn about an open-source tool to facilitate this process, of which I&#8217;m a maintainer, and you could be too!</p>",

Ada realises how crucial it is to control technology and decides to stand up to the mighty inventor Zangemann.This workshop will also intend to explore ways to promote diversity and gender equity in the Free Software community and beyond. Together we will identify the challenges women* face in participating in such communities and discuss how we can create more inclusive environments, especially for the future generations.We encourage you to join us to share your experiences, ideas and perspectives, and collaborate in creating a more inclusive and diverse future in the Free Software community for all.</p>\n<p><b>REGISTRATION NEEDED AT: </b><a href=\"https://pretix.eu/noi-digital/sfscon24/4260077/\">https://pretix.eu/noi-digital/sfscon24/4260077/</a></p>\n<p><em>*women, inter, trans and non-binary people.</em></p>\n<p>Supported by: <strong><a href=\"https://fsfe.org/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">FSFE – Free Software Foundation Europe</a> </strong>&amp; <a href=\"https://shetechitaly.org/\"><strong>SheTech</strong></a></p>",

Furthermore, the experience is based on Tommaso’s academic research, mainly conducted for “<a href=\"https://tommi.space/csss/\">Computer Sciences are Social Sciences</a>”, his bachelor’s thesis.</p>\n<p><strong>Content</strong></p>\n<p>During the activity, Tommaso will be using a yarn his grandmother gifted him to simulate centralized and decentralized networks, employing concrete metaphors to actively involve the participants. Every individual attending the workshop will be given a quote or an image relevant in the early and contemporary history of the Internet, and they will be asked to share it as the story unfolds.</p>\n<p>Allowing them to understand the essential challenges society faces in relation to technological advancement, participants will be empowered to get involved in the Fediverse, especially understanding the importance of decentralization, Free Software, and the political role played by technical tools.</p>\n<p><strong>Notes</strong></p>\n<p>Given its malleable and open structure, the content of the workshop can be adapted, enriched, and edited to match the key topics of SFSCON 2024 in the best possible way.</p>\n<p>The interactive parts of the workshop can be limited and a more theoretical presentation, diving in the thoughts of philosophers and computer sciences, could be added, too.</p>\n<p>Supported by: <strong><a href=\"https://fsfe.org/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">FSFE – Free Software Foundation Europe</a></strong></p>",

       "description": "<p>Intrigued by 22+ hours of battery life with comparable performance to current Intel / AMD systems? Starting from June this year a bunch of new ARM based laptops have been launched. All major laptop vendors launched devices, with over 33 to choose from at the time of this writing.</p>\n<p>While ARM based laptops have been available for years, they mostly have been targeted as cheap entry level ChromeBooks or MacBooks designed for MacOS only. Luckily with this new wave of ARM based laptops there should be something for everybody.</p>\n<p>The core question is how well they behave under Linux. Being designed for<br />\nWindows-on-ARM there is a risk Linux support is rudimentary at best. Stefan set out to test this and is reporting back here. Does a boot with UEFI work out of the box? Are all hardware features supported? Is the firmware for various drivers available? How is the performance?</p>\n<p>And the most important question: how does it stack up against an Intel based laptop from the same timeframe as daily driver for software development?</p>",

But, benny has spent the last 10 years building drama-free communities with a different kind of success.</p>\n<p>While many open-source projects rally members through shared frustrations or negativity, AlmaLinux took the more challenging path of uniting people through thoughtful dialogue and focusing on helping each other. By prioritizing respect, collaboration, and inclusivity, the AlmaLinux community grew healthier and stronger without the need for battle cries or infusing drama. Learn how this approach not only built a stable and thriving community around AlmaLinux, but is also setting a new standard for open-source communities &#8211; and proving that progress doesn’t have to be divisive.</p>",
