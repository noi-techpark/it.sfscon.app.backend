        <subtitle>Making laws with the Open Source community in mind</subtitle>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;Over the past three years, the Open Source Community has had to mobilise to fix flaws in European Union policy initiatives, like the Cyber Resilience Act, Product Liability Directive, and the AI act, all of which could have negatively impacted Open Source developers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This talk explores why this mobilisation was necessary, how the Community is preparing for future legislation, and how the Open Source community has changed the way the EU makes and implements laws.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It will then delve into the particular case of the AI act and its Open Source AI exemption. It will cover how the exemption came about, why it has prompted a wave of AI open-washing, and what can be done to fix it.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Let’s all get over the CRA!</title>
        <url>https://www.sfscon.it/talks/lets-all-get-over-the-cra/</url>
        <language/>

        <subtitle>how I stopped worrying about the consequences of the CRA for Open Source innovation in Europe and moved to something else</subtitle>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;The adoption of the CRA (Cyber Resilience Act) has caused some real anxiety among the FOSS ecosystem. Even in its amended form, many questions remain opened and debated, and more to the point, a lot of uncertainty still surrounds it, not just at the level of its general architecture but also at the implementation level.&lt;br /&gt;
It is perhaps fair to mention that the CRA itself does not exist in a void and is building on already existing regulations and ideas. However, it should be explained how the CRA itself was not born inside the institutions of the European Union but is an almost pure product of governmental cyber security circles and agencies. Because of that, the digital ecosystem at large is at pain understanding some of its logic. This talk will start with what we know and what we can infer from the CRA, and how it fits within the general regulatory framework of the European Union. We will thus clarify the following points:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;#8211; what does the CRA mean in terms of software security assessment and certification &amp;#8211; and how that plays a key role in understanding what the CRA is and what it is not&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;#8211; CRA within the European regulatory framework&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;#8211; CRA implementation: the bad, the ugly, and the unknown&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We will then discuss what the concerns are for the FOSS communities. Most notably:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;#8211; barriers of entry for Free Software companies, esp. the small and medium ones&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;#8211; legal inability to develop Free and Open Source Software&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;#8211; what will Free and Open Source software foundations do in edge cases and what are they expected to bring in terms of guidance to the companies contributing to their projects&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It will then discuss how we can best prepare for it, and make some suggestions on how to solve FOSS specific challenges related to CRA. In particular the talk will explore the following possibilities:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;#8211; evolving the role or cross project security teams&lt;br /&gt;
-promoting best practices in development (CI CD, code auditability) turning the CRA against proprietary software practices&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;#8211; Pooling security audits&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;#8211; Better release management&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Last but not least, this talk will discuss the economics behind the CRA and why this may not end up being less of a problem than we think.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>On the ethical challenges raised by robots powered by Artificial Intelligence</title>
        <url>https://www.sfscon.it/talks/on-the-ethical-challenges-raised-by-robots-powered-by-artificial-intelligence/</url>
        <language/>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;The integration of generative AI into robot systems has the potential to boost several industries by enabling robots to understand their environments, create courses of action, and autonomously react to complex situations. However, the adoption of generative AI techniques brings about profound ethical concerns that need to be addressed to ensure the responsible development and deployment of such technologies. In this talk, I will explore the multifaceted ethical challenges associated with generative AI-powered robots, focusing on issues such as robot autonomy, decision-making, accountability of robot actions, and their impact on humans and society as a whole.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>CRA &amp; PLD Liability rules and Software Freedom</title>
        <url>https://www.sfscon.it/talks/cra-pld-liability-rules-and-software-freedom/</url>
        <language/>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;With CRA and PLD liability rules for software have been introduced with a broad exception for Free Software. After long and intense debates individual developers and non for profit work are safeguarded. I will shed light on those new rules.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Already at an early stage, the FSFE argued in a hearing in the EU Parliament, for the inclusion of clear and precise exemptions for Free Software development in the legislation and for liability to be transferred to those who significantly financially benefit from it on the market.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the future, individual developers and non-profit development of Free Software will be exempt from the CRA and the PLD. Nevertheless, the wording in both the regulations are different and a standardisation processes and guidelines are still being drawn up.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In this talk I will discuss what this new regulation means for software freedom in future and what happens at this stage and how to be involved in implementation.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>We went to court against Apple &amp;#8211; a case for Software Freedom</title>
        <url>https://www.sfscon.it/talks/for-the-right-of-general-purpose-computers/</url>
        <language/>
        <abstract>Breaking lock-ins over devices with Free Software</abstract>
        <subtitle>Breaking lock-ins over devices with Free Software</subtitle>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;Our smartphones, tablets, laptops, and other connected devices are general purpose computers. That means we can potentially run any software we want to make full use of the hardware. This potential is fostered by Free Software.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, device manufacturers, vendors, and internet platforms have been restricting software freedom by exercising their monopolistic control over end-user equipment. This power is used over key features and components of devices such as operating systems, browsers, and app stores.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Basic freedoms such as installing and uninstalling software are being unfairly limited by these companies, commonly referred to as &amp;#8220;gatekeepers&amp;#8221;, because of their monopolistic control over devices.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As a concrete example, this talk will present the policy and legal work of FSFE in denouncing the detrimental commercial practices of a worldwide known gatekeeper: Apple.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Apple&amp;#8217;s monopolistic power over its devices is detrimental to Free Software and a high risk for the right of general purpose computers. The company&amp;#8217;s &amp;#8220;notarization&amp;#8221;, its barriers to software freedom and lack of interoperability are highly negative to Free Software.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In conclusion, this talk will present Device Neutrality as a policy solution to enable end-users to bypass gatekeepers in order to run Free Software independently of the control exercised by hardware manufacturers, vendors, and platforms. Device Neutrality can enable end&amp;#8211;users to regain control over their devices.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>25 Years of Copyleft Enforcement: The Road Ahead for Defending Software Rights</title>
        <url>https://www.sfscon.it/talks/25-years-of-copyleft-enforcement-the-road-ahead-for-defending-software-rights/</url>
        <language/>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;In 1999, I worked my first GPL enforcement matter: a large storage had made proprietary modifications to GNU tar and failed to release the complete, corresponding source code to its customers. In early 2000, I did my first “CCS check” (complete, corresponding sourcecode check) — wherein one attempts to build the “CCS candidate” provided by the vendor to investigate whether the CCS candidate is actually complete, and whether it corresponds to the binaries that were distributed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In those days, violations of copyleft licenses were rare, and once uncovered, companies eventually corrected their behavior. Yet, even then, it took years of work to convince the company to comply. And often, by the time compliance was achieved, a new generation of the product was released.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;25 years later, we face the same problems with nearly every vendor.&lt;br /&gt;
Almost every product on the market today contains Linux, BusyBox, the GNU C Library, GNU Bash, and dozen other packages licensed under the GPL and/or LGPL. Almost none of these companies, even if an offer for source code is made, provide CCS.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This talk will look both to the past and future as we investigate software rights and freedoms of the average consumer, and how we reached this difficult situation. Attendees can learn the history of copyleft and its enforcement, and leave with an understanding of how much work remains and what individuals can do to make a real impact on the rights of users under copyleft.&lt;/p&gt;

        <subtitle>A newly released standard for complete information</subtitle>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;SBOMs are a crucial tool for understanding the composition of software, which is particularly important in the context of managing security risks and licensing compliance. Recent regulatory efforts from, among others, the US and the EU, explicitly move towards requiring SBOM for each software delivery.&lt;br /&gt;
SPDX (System Package Data Exchange) is a freely available ISO standard that provides a set of specifications for communicating SBOM information. It offers a common format for companies and organizations to share important data accurately and efficiently.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This presentation will delve into the details of the newly released version of SPDX, providing a comprehensive understanding of their importance in the software industry.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>(re)classifying FOSS licenses</title>
        <url>https://www.sfscon.it/talks/reclassifying-foss-licenses/</url>
        <language/>
        <abstract>New strategy for classifying licenses in a better way</abstract>
        <subtitle>New strategy for classifying licenses in a better way</subtitle>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;There are many efforts trying to classify licenses, for different use cases such as checking compatibility or for complying with the license terms. Most of these efforts seem to, explicitly or implicitly, have a certain use case in mind.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This project sets out to:&lt;br /&gt;
Consider provisioning case &amp;#8211; how is the software provided to your user (e.g. binary distribution, SaaS, Web UI)&lt;br /&gt;
Consider use case &amp;#8211; how is the software used (e.g. compiler, library)&lt;br /&gt;
Trust model &amp;#8211; why should you trust the contributor of a classification or you should be able to exclude a contributor’s work etc&lt;br /&gt;
Identify and generalize FOSS license clauses&lt;br /&gt;
Identify and generalize when a clauses is triggered&lt;br /&gt;
Determine how clauses are compatible with each other (a license clause matrix)&lt;br /&gt;
Identify the clauses and triggers for each license&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Keeping track of how 100 licenses are compatible with each other will result in a matrix with 10 000 (100 x 100) values. This is hard to maintain. Extending to 200 licenses requires 40 000 values. By instead looking at the license clauses we will end up with a much smaller problem, assuming we identify 20-30 of them, which will result in a matrix of 400-900 values. This is big, but maintainable. Adding a new license will not increase the size of the (license clause) matrix, which means that our approach scales much better. From the license definitions and license clause matrix we can compile a license compatibility matrix (for fast compatibility lookup).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This project sets out to provide to users:&lt;br /&gt;
A license obligation checklist for each provisioning case &amp;#8211; for making compliance checks easy&lt;br /&gt;
A license compatibility matrix for each provisioning case &amp;#8211; for fast compatibility lookup&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;All data and source code will be released under FOSS licenses.&lt;/p&gt;

As part of our work there over the past 6 years, we have looked at hundreds of participating Free Software projects, to assist them with their legal and licensing questions, as well as to help them become REUSE compliant.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This talk will speak about some simple trends in Free Software legal and licensing that we&amp;#8217;ve observed over the years in independent Free Software projects and their developers, and how these affect aspects of the Free Software ecosystem.&lt;/p&gt;

In this talk, we&amp;#8217;ll summarize key results, share recommendations for businesses leveraging 3Os, and demonstrate tools developed to aid knowledge generators and supporting organizations in navigating the legal and business implications of 3Os. Additionally, we&amp;#8217;ll discuss the future of ZOOOM and its potential impact on the industry and research.&lt;/p&gt;

        <language/>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;In an era where sustainability and responsible innovation are not just valued but expected, Open Source Program Offices (OSPOs) stand at the forefront of a transformative wave that merges open innovation with sustainable business practices. This session explores the pivotal role of OSPOs in fostering open innovation environments that not only drive technological advancement but also align with the principles of impact-oriented capitalism&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We will delve into how OSPOs can leverage open source ecosystems to catalyze change within their organizations, promoting not just compliance and security but also environmental, social, and governance (ESG) goals. Through case studies and practical insights, attendees will learn how integrating OSPO strategies with corporate sustainability objectives can create a powerful synergy that propels companies toward a more ethical and profitable future.&lt;/p&gt;

        <subtitle>The Dilemma of AI Customization</subtitle>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;When considering the core values of mass customization, such as individual expression, fun in co-creating, and creativity, AI may introduce disadvantages, potentially leading to the homogenization of experiences. This lightning talk aims to explore the potential risks and drawbacks of utilizing AI in mass customization, highlighting the tension between leveraging technology for customization and preserving the unique human elements that form the foundation of personalized experiences. Could the reliance on algorithms diminish the consumer’s role in the creative process? If so, it might challenge the essence of what makes mass customization truly unique and innovative.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Fostering Innovation in IT Businesses through Open Source Software Involvement</title>
        <url>https://www.sfscon.it/talks/fostering-innovation-in-it-businesses-through-open-source-software-involvement/</url>
        <language/>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;All IT companies depend on free and open source software to some extent. Once they reach a certain size, they spontaneously become supporters of the projects on which they base their business. This happens because of first order consequences: my business depends on it, if I help it strive, my business will benefit.&lt;br /&gt;
In this talk, we will address the second-order consequences of software engineers interacting with open source projects, and show why dedicating internal resources to this activity is an effective strategy for enabling the discovery of new or modified (software) entities, which is the prerequisite for innovation.&lt;br /&gt;
The benefits are visible for companies of any size, even if their business does not depend on a specific project to which they could contribute: compelling arguments will be presented to motivate business owners to encourage their IT staff to engage in open source activities (and to developers to convince their bosses).&lt;/p&gt;

        <abstract>How to safeguard the Free Software market against unfair competition</abstract>
        <subtitle>How to safeguard the Free Software market against unfair competition</subtitle>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;Companies that produce and sell Free Software face a problem: some competitors use unethical and destructive means to compete, making their products cheaper and winning bids. This kind of market behaviour is increasingly becoming a problem for Free Software producers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Destructive practices include marketing proprietary software under the guise of being Free Software, whether by using free/open wording, by introducing new licences that falsely appear to be free, or by imposing additional barriers that make it more difficult to use the freedoms offered by Free Software.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Other competitors sell Free Software products without contributing to their development and maintenance, profiting from the work of others but giving nothing back to the community. This allows them to offer low prices while raising the costs of maintenance for the original manufacturers. For some players, there seems to be no limit to their creativity when it comes to undercutting competitors and winning bids.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Free Software Foundation Europe has been analysing these and other problematic market practices over the last few years. In this talk we will take a closer look at them and show why they harm Free Software manufacturers and the Free Software ecosystem. We will then discuss ways to limit the success of such practices.&lt;/p&gt;

        <language/>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;Trends are cyclical, even in the tech world. A few years ago, everyone was talking about D&amp;amp;I in the workplace. This season, web accessibility absolutely occupies the first lines of code. How is it shown? Let&amp;#8217;s talk about it &amp;#8211; many do not understand how to implement it in their project.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;First, relax. This is a really complex topic that requires not only a well-created website, but also communication with real users who cannot fully use the Internet, for example, without a screen reader.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A checklist that will convince you to try implementing WA into your application:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;◦ What can be adapted for WA?&lt;br /&gt;
◦ How is WA testing done?&lt;br /&gt;
◦ How to use AI in WA?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If we haven&amp;#8217;t convinced you, then look at WA from the point of view of strengthening your personal brand in the market.&lt;/p&gt;

        <subtitle>Making LibreOffice a native part of the web, using FOSS for highly customizable office document handling in the browser, based on WASM.</subtitle>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;LibreOffice can be highly integrated into desktop and server applications and we wanted to make this also possible for web apps. Running fully client side with Web Assembly, LibreOffice can now be used and customized by a JavaScript idiomatic API, becoming an easy usable component for web development. With this Free Software opens the door to a completely different approach for bringing office document handling into the browser, then from what&amp;#8217;s known from Google Docs and Co.. Use cases may be the integration of widgets with rich text documents, including classic desktop macros, into browser based applications or enabling JavaScript to interact live with values in spreadsheets. But LibreOffice can also work as background WASM library, converting documents from and to all supported formats like ODF (ODT, &amp;#8230;), MS formats (DocX, XlsX, Doc, &amp;#8230;), PDF or HTML, while applying custom conversion filters for things like macro sanitization.&lt;/p&gt;

        <description>&lt;p&gt;Selling food products on a website or e-commerce platform in Italy is subject to the Food Information of Consumers (FIC) regulations. These regulations dictate mandatory information that must be communicated on the product page, with fines for non-compliance. In this talk, we will cover the key guidelines and legal requirements, and demonstrate how we can use software tools and artificial intelligence to check large quantities of product listings for discrepancies. Join us to learn how to streamline the process of verifying food information and enhance consumer trust.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What you may not know, is that computer resellers usually charge end-users with the Fee of the Microsoft Windows License, even before you accept the Microsoft Terms of Services, and even if you completely want to uninstall Windows from your computer.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is a critical Tech Neutrality issue that fuels non-European proprietary software houses. What to do?&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Open Access for Museum Collections and Research</title>
        <url>https://www.sfscon.it/talks/open-access-for-museum-collections-and-research/</url>
        <language/>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;The digital era has revolutionised the way we access information and interact with it. Museums, as custodians of cultural and historical artefacts, can benefit substantially from this transformation. Open Access and FOSS can greatly increase the potential of museums for public outreach: enhance their educational impact and inspire new forms of cultural engagement and knowledge discovery. For example, by digitising collections and enabling Open Access for diverse audiences, accessibility barriers are eliminated and thousands of hidden treasures become available to both researchers and the wider public. Additionally, innovative data visualisations via FOSS platforms can reveal compelling insights into object collections and the research associated with them; Open Access can thus make complex research accessible and engaging to a broader audience. Through such practices, museums can democratise their activities and enrich the visitor experience. The process is not without obstacles; common challenges museums face in adopting Open Access policies are copyright issues, data privacy, and resource limitations.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The presentation will discuss the aforementioned opportunities and issues currently emerging in the museum sector. The talk will be illustrated with examples from the Deutsches Museum in Munich, the world’s largest museum of science and technology.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Journeying through Data Spaces – New Path to Interoperability?</title>
        <url>https://www.sfscon.it/talks/journeying-through-data-spaces-new-path-to-interoperability/</url>
        <language/>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;Data spaces play a pivotal role in advancing digitalisation and interoperability within and across different business domains, both on a national level and cross-borders. However, it&amp;#8217;s not a new concept since its roots date back to 2005. The definition has evolved over the years and today it covers all four layers of interoperability defined by the European Interoperability Framework (EIF).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Today, the term data space has several different definitions depending on whom you ask. Also, multiple international initiatives are working on data spaces to create common governance models, specifications, reference implementations, etc. The aim of this talk is to discuss the data space concept, different actors working on data spaces and their roles and responsibilities, and available specifications and building blocks.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>DOOF – an Open Source Orchestration Framework for Decentralized Consent Management</title>
        <url>https://www.sfscon.it/talks/doof-an-open-source-orchestration-framework-for-decentralized-consent-management/</url>
        <language/>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;DOOF stands for Data Ownership Orchestration Framework. It is a framework developed for NGI Trustchain Project within a broader Next Generation Internet scheme of the EU in order to address a lack of decentralization in consent management regarding users’ sharing of their data. The aim of DOOF is to revolutionize personal data governance and normalise the deployment of consent management and privacy enhancing technologies. It uniquely enables individuals to control their rights over data sharing, fostering greater trust and regulatory compliance, essential for building a resilient and transparent data economy.&lt;br /&gt;
DOOF targets the gap in current centralized consent management, where GDPR and Data Act demand seamless data exchange and regulatory compliance. Yet the sharing and consent management regarding users’ data is centralized &amp;#8211; a responsibility of the data intermediary &amp;#8211; which comes with great costs and liabilities.&lt;br /&gt;
With DOOF, Ecosteer aims to separate and decouple the layer of physical data transferring from the layer of consent management. DOOF offers companies a framework that allows them to easily adopt Privacy Enhancing Technologies (PETs) for the actual sharing of data and enforcement of users’ decisions.&lt;br /&gt;
The framework consists of a set of SDKs, libraries and a Smart Contract for decentralised consent management. The main component of the framework is a worker pipeline, consisting of extensible, plug-in processors. This pipeline contributes to the low-code movement, offering a framework that can be easily adapted to different business needs. Companies can easily build verticals on this existing framework by just extending some of its functionalities.&lt;br /&gt;
This talk will focus on the concept of decentralized consent management as well as pipeline-based orchestration framework, outlining the process of creating a novel, re-usable and extensible open-source project.&lt;/p&gt;

        <description>&lt;p&gt;In recent years, Open Data has revolutionized the way governments, companies and individuals access and use information. The openness of public and private data represents a milestone on the path towards a more transparent, participatory and competitive society.&lt;br /&gt;
Open Data represent a resource for society and businesses and contribute to the development of a territory. This added value manifests itself in various forms, including transparency and democratic participation, technological innovation, economic development and improved services.&lt;br /&gt;
The talk will focus on specific case studies from the Open Data Hub in the Autonomous Province of Bolzano, a region which has shown a strong commitment to the adoption and promotion of Open Data.&lt;br /&gt;
Through the analysis of these cases, the aim is to demonstrate how the initiatives based on Open Data have led to concrete and tangible results, offering useful and applicable insights also in extra-regional contexts.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Sensor Things API QGIS core provider</title>
        <url>https://www.sfscon.it/talks/sensor-things-api-qgis-core-provider/</url>
        <language/>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;Sensor Things API (STA, in short), is an OGC specification for storing and retrieving (timeseries of) Sensor Observations.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;FROST-Server, developed by Fraunhofer IOSB, is one of the most consolidated implementations of STA with a very detailed documentation and a lot of background information. The implementation includes a REST endpoint to insert, modify and retrieve STA entities with a query language based on OASIS Odata URL patterns and query options.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A QGIS experimental plugin, developed by Deda Next srl in 2022 and implemented in python within the EU project Air-Break, is currently available to connect to STA-compliant endpoints and retrieve sensor data (e.g. European Air Quality data from this endpoint). The plugin has an embedded data provider which is currently designed to retrieve sensors&amp;#8217; locations as geometrical features and then request the time series of observations for specific locations.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, in order to offer support to a wider range of use cases and more complex queries on STA model entities, Faunalia and DedaNext (funded by BRGM) started to plan for a dedicated STA data provider for GIS: a development group was set up involving the QGIS community, formal acceptance of the proposal was sought within the QGIS community (QEP #257) and possible development options for the provider (ex: python vs C++) were analyzed. As STA is an OGC standard, it seemed appropriate to implement it in C++ as a core element of QGIS.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Development has therefore been carried out in close interaction with the QGIS developer community with the focus on supporting complex STA queries, implementing among other things:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;#8211; expansion of relations among model entities;&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;#8211; independent attribute filtering and sorting on all entities;&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;#8211; efficient data caching to limit unnecessary data transfers;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This new core element is available from QGIS version 3.37 (currently only available as nightly release).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Finally, plans are underway to develop a new version of the QGIS STA plugin (originally developed by Deda Next within project AirBreak) focused on data exploration and analysis that will be able to leverage on the newly released core STA data provider to support a wider range of use cases, such as:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;#8211; Time series analysis: This is the case of the old STA plugin. Fetch Locations, show them on the map. Then, upon selection of one location, fetch all related Things and Datastreams, and finally, fetch the Observations of the desired Datastream to be shown in a table or plot;&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;#8211; Space-time series analysis: Given a selected set of Datastreams from a moving sensor, get all the FeaturesOfInterest of those Datastreams and plot them on the map, so to have a view of the path of the moving sensor and a hold on its values on every part of that path;&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;#8211; Monitoring and inspection: Fetch all the latest observations of all Datastreams (or a selection based on the ObservedProperty) and show these at their Locations, styled by the result of the latest Observation of a given ObservedProperty. Then, in a second phase (eg. if a value is over a threshold), inspect the full timeseries of that one Datastream.&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;#8211; Tracking of moving things: Show all Things with their current Location and their HistoricalLocations with the Temporal Controller (time slider).&lt;/p&gt;

        <description>&lt;p&gt;The EO4MULTIHA project (https://eo4multihazards.gmv.com/), funded by the European Space Agency, aims at developing an open database gathering and harmonizing event information coming from already existing event databases to support multi-hazard(-risk) research.&lt;br /&gt;
To pursue this aim, this project which has been developed in the EURAC research, Center for Sensing Solutions, presents a comprehensive web application designed to analyze and visualize multi-hazard events, developed using Django and PostgreSQL. Leveraging the strengths of open-source technologies, the application provides a robust platform for researchers, policymakers, and the public to access and understand the complexities of multi-hazard scenarios. The main parts of this web application is explained in the following paragraphs:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;(i) The core of the application is built with Django, a high-level Python web framework known for its rapid development capabilities and clean, pragmatic design. PostgreSQL, a powerful and scalable open-source relational database system, ensures efficient data storage and management. Together, these technologies offer a reliable and flexible foundation for handling diverse and large datasets.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;(ii) To visualize the events, Leaflet Map which is an open source contributor to the OpenStreet Map has been used.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;(iii) To populate the database, the application exploits various RESTful APIs, integrating data from multiple sources, including satellite imagery, climatological records, in-situ measurements, and relevant statistical data. This multi-source approach allows for a comprehensive characterization of risks, exposures, and susceptibilities associated with multi-hazard events benefiting from the Open Data Standards such as OGC Standard.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;(iiii)Key features of the application include spatial and temporal filtering of events, cross-linking of data sets for enhanced reusability, and compliance with open standards such as RESTful APIs and OGC standards. The platform is designed to be expandable, with the potential to incorporate additional locations and datasets in the future.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;By providing an accessible online platform, this web application aims to support the understanding and analysis of multi-hazard events, facilitating informed decision-making and effective disaster management strategies. The use of open-source technologies and the integration of diverse data sources underscore the project&amp;#8217;s commitment to innovation, scalability, and community-driven development.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>BASIC CORE South Tyrol</title>

        <abstract>A project to solve the topographical complexity of the National Spatial Data Catalogue</abstract>
        <subtitle>A project to solve the topographical complexity of the National Spatial Data Catalogue</subtitle>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;The project has its roots in a precise and simplified cartographic updating methodology introduced by the Consortium of Municipalities of the Province of Bolzano in the early 2000s. This methodology, which was consolidated over the years, could no longer be applied following the adoption of the Territorial Data Catalogue (Ministerial Decree 10.11.2011 &amp;#8220;Technical rules for defining the content specifications of geotopographic databases&amp;#8221; and subsequent amendments) due to the complexity and articulation of the new national model. The primary objective of the project was to research and define a minimum set of information that could adequately describe the territory within the typical use context of the public administration, ensuring its sustainability in terms of the ability to keep it updated and aligned with the transformations of the territory. Simplifying the definition and understanding of the basic technical layer that every public administration producing geographic data must guarantee within their institutional activities for geotopographic databases is a fundamental step to adequately support territorial management. Lightened of the informational content already managed by the Provincial Administration within archives or sectoral Information Systems, and consequently already included in existing and consolidated maintenance and updating flows, as well as everything that can be considered three-dimensional data nowadays obtainable through faster and more accurate systems, the Basic Core (BC) specification was produced by reorganizing and simplifying the information levels contained in the National Territorial Data Catalogue with reference to the identified minimum subset of required information known as the National Core (NC). To make it practically usable, only the themes considered objectively useful and easily updatable were included in the Basic Core. Our presentation will outline the key points that enabled the design of the Basic Core content specification and illustrates the technological tools developed, as well as the automatic transformation and simplification procedures that led to the significant reduction in the number of object classes provided by the National Core (from 59 to only 23), demonstrating that the Basic Core project is not a merely theoretical exercise, but a practical and concrete application currently tested and successfully used in South Tyrol. The specifically developed Dashboard for managing, correcting and updating the provincial Geotopographic Database, built on the basis of this new simplified specification, will be explained in detail. This dashboard allows effective operation on every management aspect, including the crucial task of sharing maintenance responsibilities between the Provincial and Municipal levels, thus ensuring the full efficiency of this fundamental geographic base. Particular attention will be given to illustrating the guided editing functionality available directly from the online interface, as well as the options for creating and exporting QGIS projects. QGIS projects are designed to perform the most significant and advanced corrections and/or updates. We will conclude the overview of this innovative system with a demonstration of the processes for reimporting and validating the updated data. Finally, practical cases in which the Basic Core has been used will be presented, as well as future developments, already planned and those still under evaluation, that the system will receive in order to refine and make its use more robust.&lt;/p&gt;

My main goal in any project in which I have participated has always been to use the data collected in the only (for me) useful and smart way. That is, draw practical and concrete information that would allow any \&quot;system\&quot; to be effectively managed and monitored. I dedicated myself to research and data collection activities in the field, development of relational databases, creation of decision support systems, software development and teaching\/training of many stakeholders who could then continue and effectively replicate the various management approaches implemented. Thus, making the projects self-sustainable. My education as a biologist also enabled me to translate the \&quot;scientific mindset\&quot; so that more technical\/managerial members, such as policymakers, for example, could concretely understand the results obtained and use them as a robust and solid basis for their final decisions. I have worked in many countries around the world, and this has allowed me to relate with so many different characters, but especially in regard to this I have realized my ability to work with the most diverse types of people and in the most diverse situations possible. I am curious beyond measure; for me, the most important thing is to understand the \&quot;working mechanism\&quot; of what I am dedicated to. Regardless of the topic or field. I am also sometimes a bit \&quot;lunatic\&quot;, but very logical. I like to work together with a wide range of professionality and personalities, and I consider myself a good communicator. Furthermore, I am passionate about so many things, for sure too many, engineering, mechanics, computer science, photography, new technologies in general, but above all there is in me an absolute love for the nature that surrounds us. A source of calm as well as deep inspiration.&quot;" url="https://www.sfscon.it/speakers/edoardo-scepi/">Edoardo Scepi</person>

        <subtitle>The experience of Think Open at CIMeC</subtitle>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;Think Open is an Open Science initiative born within CIMeC in 2018 whose goal is to build a virtual space within which researchers at the Center can share different kinds of outputs from research, integrating and merging information from different sources and stages of the knowledge-building process. A number of achievements have been made over the years, both from the point of view of training (seminars, hands-on, courses for doctoral students, awards, etc.) and implementation of best practices (code and data sharing, adoption of free-software tools, etc.). Here we will describe how sharing open practices in everyday working routines foster connections between people, creating practice-based communities.&lt;/p&gt;

        <subtitle>Gathering information from the OBD (On Board Diagnostic) port of your car could be challenging</subtitle>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;Any car has a diagnostic connector from which you can gather and/or set data from the various ECU (Engine Control Unit) that are present in your car, such as odometer, temperatures, motor rotation speed, accelerator depression percentage, wheel angle, lights, and – in an electric car – information about battery, remain energy, charging/discharging power, etc.&lt;br /&gt;
The big challenge is that the meaning of fathered data is usually not known and car manufacturers are reluctant to share this information.&lt;br /&gt;
This talk will illustrate how to scan the available data and make reverse engineering in order to try to create a shared database containing (useful) car data and PIDs (Parameter IDs) from ECUs of your car.&lt;/p&gt;

        <subtitle>Do you really know how to unleash and manage innovation?</subtitle>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;In the era of the Fifth Industrial Revolution, leaders, innovators and pioneers design, generate, and shape future-proof organizations, driven by a meaningful purpose promoting social impacts, combining emerging technologies and new ways of collaborating and conceiving work. While the &amp;#8220;why&amp;#8221; is clear and quite declared by many, the &amp;#8220;what&amp;#8221; to do and the &amp;#8220;how&amp;#8221; to do it remain very nebulous and, in some cases, obscure. Those ones who lead innovation within an organization suffer the innovation paradox: must innovate without knowing what and how. Innovators and pioneers are often alone, without a framework and processes for an open innovation execution. How can we unlock and unleash innovation, ensuring that the actions taken are always driven by what is truly needed to evolve your organization?&lt;/p&gt;

        <abstract>How I applied design-thinking to re-design the Italian Free Software Community</abstract>
        <subtitle>How I applied design-thinking to re-design the Italian Free Software Community</subtitle>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;The role of Deputy Coordinator Italy within the Free Software Foundation Europe (FSFE) was born in 2022 out of the need of re-establishing the presence of the Foundation on the territory. I designed this three years experimental project together with the &lt;a href="https://freesoftwarelab.noi.bz.it/"&gt;Free Software Lab&lt;/a&gt; of NOI Techpark with the value proposition of (re)designing the FSFE Italian Community.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The project followed a human centric approach, moving along the five core stages of design-thinking. The goal of my talk is to describe the FSFE Italy project and the design-thinking approach adopted.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The first year (Y1) served as the understanding phase: I got involved as an FSFE representative in the main communication channels used by the Free Software (FS) community on the territory. I conducted interviews with volunteers, associations’ heads and enthusiasts, took part into the main FS events organized on the territory, mapped all stakeholders (understanding-observing) and created my own point of view (POV). By the end of 2022 I had already became an established FSFE representative on the territory, having gathered inputs and ideas on how to kick off the community into year two (Y2). The goal of year two was to build on these new ideas (ideation) and put these thoughts into action (prototyping) by finding common goals and activities with the main FS associations active on the territory and signing Memorandum of Understandings, preparing the ground to test it in the third year (Y3). Guess what was the result?&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>NGI: No more EU funding for Free Software?!</title>
        <url>https://www.sfscon.it/talks/ngi-no-more-eu-funding-for-free-software/</url>
        <language/>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;During the summer the European Commission made the decision to stop funding Free Software projects within the Next Generation Internet initiative (NGI). This decision results in a loss of €27 million for software freedom. Since 2018, the European Commission has supported the Free Software ecosystem through NGI, that provided funding and technical assistance to Free Software projects. This decision unfortunately exposes a larger issue: that software freedom in the EU needs more stable, long-term financial support. The ease with which this funding was excluded underlines this need.&lt;br /&gt;
This talk shows the urgent need for sustainable, long-term financial support for Free Software to ensure Europe&amp;#8217;s technological independence.&lt;/p&gt;

        <subtitle>Why Foundations are Essential</subtitle>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;Have you ever worked on a project that didn&amp;#8217;t use any open source tools, libraries, or products? Didn&amp;#8217;t think so&amp;#8230;Using open source has been such an integral part of our daily work life that we don&amp;#8217;t even think about it. We just expect it to be available, secure, stable, and bug-free. But how many of you are actually contributing back to an open source project?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This session will go through a couple of the aspects to consider when you are embarking on your open source journey. We will look at different kinds of open source projects, and what the open source foundations bring to the table.&lt;/p&gt;

        <description>&lt;p&gt;The Sovereign Tech Fund is a new funding program for critical free software infrastructure by the German government. As part of this, members of the GNOME community have been working on fixing important issues across the free desktop stack. This includes security, accessibility, maintainability, hardware support, and more.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In this talk Sonny and Tobias will give an overview of how we organized the project, the work done as part of it, and the massive impact a relatively small amount of public money can have on making the free desktop better.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>MoodleXR: A Next-Generation Open-Source Platform for Immersive Learning</title>
        <url>https://www.sfscon.it/talks/moodlexr-a-next-generation-open-source-platform-for-immersive-learning/</url>
        <language/>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;This project aims to develop a state-of-the-art Learning Management System (LMS) based on Moodle, optimized for delivering Virtual Reality (VR) and Augmented Reality (AR) learning modules.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;By leveraging the open-source nature of Moodle and integrating advanced immersive technologies, the project seeks to create an innovative educational platform that transforms traditional learning experiences.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The LMS will incorporate open-source VR/AR tools and libraries, such as A-Frame, AR.js, and Blender, enabling educators to seamlessly integrate and manage immersive content. It will support various VR headsets and AR devices, ensuring broad accessibility. The platform will feature interactive learning modules, robust analytics, and scalable infrastructure, all built on open-source technologies like Kubernetes and Matomo.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Additionally, the project will emphasize accessibility and privacy compliance, utilizing tools like WAVE and Let’s Encrypt.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;By fostering a community-driven development model, this LMS will offer a flexible, cost-effective solution that revolutionizes education through experiential learning, making it more engaging, interactive, and effective for students and educators alike.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Implementing digital examinations in free software systems</title>
        <url>https://www.sfscon.it/talks/implementing-digital-examinations-in-free-software-systems/</url>
        <language/>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;In Finnish upper secondary schools course and final exams have been digital for some years now. Ordinary student laptops are routinely booted from USB flash drives to a special operating system, which provides a restricted environment allowing students to take an exam with no distractions or tools to cheat. Up to these days, this was implemented with Debian GNU/Linux, also meaning that student laptops must be Linux-compatible.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is now changing. Not every modern laptop can simply boot from a USB drive to run Linux, these including chromebooks, Apple laptops and some new Windows laptops. Some schools may want to buy these devices and do not want a separate set of computers only for examinations. The current system is being replaced by an exam application, meant to run on different operating systems, which are to provide guarantees that no cheating can occur. The exam application activates the &amp;#8220;assessment mode&amp;#8221;, provided by operating system vendors, and this mode should provide a safe place where no cheating can occur, even on computers owned by the students.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Does that even make sense? Can that really be done, and with free software? In this presentation we take a peek at some technologies in Linux systems that can be used to secure a computer against an attacker with a physical access to the machine. We will also look at possible ways to implement an &amp;#8220;assessment mode&amp;#8221; in Linux desktops.&lt;/p&gt;

        <subtitle>Our experiences and how you can contribute</subtitle>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;Today it is impossible to imagine daily life without software. The majority of us can&amp;#8217;t spend a single day without using it. People use software in the workplace, on laptops, and on mobile phones. Software is also found in less obvious places however: in trains, cars, televisions, washing-machines, fridges, and many other devices. None of these devices could function without software. Without software we couldn&amp;#8217;t write e-mails, make phone calls, go shopping, or travel as we are accustomed to. Software is our society&amp;#8217;s central tool. How do we ensure that the next generation is motivated and capable of shaping technology for society&amp;#8217;s benefits?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Free Software Foundation Europe&amp;#8217;s volunteers and staff have interacted with over 1700 children between 6 to 10 years in the past months. Children, especially girls, afterwards were motivated to start experimenting with hardware and software. In the discussions we saw that they realise how crucial technology will be for them. Furthermore with the FSFE&amp;#8217;s coding competition &amp;#8220;Youth Hacking 4 Freedom&amp;#8221; we gathered experiences working with teenagers who program, tinker, and have fun with software.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Learn more about the experiences how the FSFE sparks children&amp;#8217;s and teenagers interest to tinker, experiment and program. Furthermore you will see how fulfilling those activities can be for yourself.&lt;/p&gt;

        <description>&lt;p&gt;We have all heard that there is &amp;#8216;Intel inside&amp;#8217;, but what is inside Intel? Almost all integrated circuits today are literally black boxes. They may contain unwanted or malicious features and, most importantly, they do not encourage reuse, nor do they allow it. The two main causes of such secrecy are: 1. standard design tools explicitly forbid the publication of any output, and 2. most foundries disallow disclosing technology details. Designers moreover face additional problems: The licence cost of standard design tools is unaffordable for most SMEs (unless questionable discount policies are applied), and lock-in threats arise at many levels, from IP blocks to foundry details to file formats. Yet exceptional progress has been made in recent years: Hundreds of silicon chips have been designed using free and open-source tools, and three foundries have made details of their processes public: The doors to free silicon are open! Hence how is politics reacting? What are the next steps to be taken? What are the opportunities for users, society and companies?&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Opt out? Opt in? Opt Green! Bringing Free Software To Eco-Consumers</title>
        <url>https://www.sfscon.it/talks/opt-out-opt-in-opt-green-bringing-free-software-to-eco-consumers/</url>
        <language/>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;Free Software gives consumers what they want, but many don&amp;#8217;t know it &amp;#8230; yet! We aim to change that by reaching out directly to eco-consumers in the &amp;#8220;Opt Green&amp;#8221; project, a new KDE Eco initiative funded by the German Environmental Agency.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Consumers want sustainable software: in a recent European poll 50% of respondents say the two primary reasons they purchase a new device are non-functioning software and software performance issues. This is as good a time as ever for an &amp;#8220;Opt Green&amp;#8221; message. In the next couple of years Windows 10 end-of-life and the phasing out of Intel-based macOS support will make e-waste out of hundreds of millions of computers. Functioning but vendor-abandoned devices can stay out of the landfill and in use for many years to come. With software designed for users&amp;#8217; needs, not vendors&amp;#8217;, it is possible to run software on the devices one already owns. Lean, efficient Free Software even runs on devices that are decades old. This is good for users, and better for the environment!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In this lightning talk I will provide an overview of the whys and hows of KDE Eco&amp;#8217;s &amp;#8220;Opt Green&amp;#8221; initiative. Through campaigns and workshops over the next 2 years, we will raise awareness about environmental issues driven by software and demonstrate the power of Free Software to drive down resource use and keep devices running smoothly for years beyond official vendor support. This is all possible because Free Software *is* right-to-repair software: it removes vendor dependencies and guarantees transparency and user autonomy, providing full control over software, and thus hardware. I will describe the ways we plan to reach our target audience, including materials designed for eco-consumers and events well outside usual tech circles, such as open-air organic, artisanal, and fair trade markets, cultural centers, and others. These activities give us the opportunity to align our values in the Free Software community with those in allied communities striving for a sustainable modern lifestyle.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>ClapMetrics: Decoding Users’ Gender and Age Through Smartwatch Gesture Dynamics</title>
        <url>https://www.sfscon.it/talks/clapmetrics-decoding-users-gender-and-age-through-smartwatch-gesture-dynamics/</url>
        <language/>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;In this presentation, we introduce ClapMetrics &amp;#8211; an innovative and seamless method for deducing the gender and age of smartwatch users. This system ingeniously harnesses the capabilities of the smartwatch’s integrated 3D sensors — specifically, the accelerometer and gyroscope—to capture the wearer’s arm movements during a clapping action. ClapMetrics operates on the principle that each clap is a complex interplay of motion, unique to the individual, much like a fingerprint. By analyzing these movements, ClapMetrics can gather rich biometric data without any active input or effort from the user, making it a remarkably non-intrusive technology. We will delve into the specifics of how ClapMetrics processes sensor data to make its estimations. We will explore the Neural Network’s architecture, the training process, and how the model interprets the sensor data to make reliable predictions about the wearer’s gender and age.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Adoption Determinants of Open Hardware Across Industries</title>
        <url>https://www.sfscon.it/talks/adoption-determinants-of-open-hardware-across-industries/</url>
        <language/>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;Open Hardware (OH) is revolutionizing the way we approach technology in several areas, such as agriculture and healthcare. These areas, which are fundamental to food availability and human well-being, are undergoing an important shift as open hardware licensing strategies, inspired by open-source software (OSS), make solutions more accessible, affordable, and customizable. In this talk, we review major factors determining the use and adoption of OH technologies, including economic advantages, opportunities, and challenges.&lt;br /&gt;
Similar to OSS, OH applications are gaining momentum. In agriculture, farmers and researchers are turning to OH for precision farming tools, environmental monitoring, and robotics. These technologies not only reduce development costs but can be easily adapted to specific local needs, enhancing their effectiveness in diverse agricultural environments – crucial for small-scale farmers in developing countries and rural areas who face financial constraints. Likewise, the healthcare industry is benefiting from OH through the development of affordable medical devices, diagnostic tools, and treatment systems. The high costs and regulatory challenges associated with traditional medical devices often limit access to essential healthcare, especially in underdeveloped regions. Examples include open-source ventilators, syringe pumps, and diagnostic devices.&lt;br /&gt;
Applications of OH will be showcased through a comparative analysis of successful projects, particularly those with high engagement on platforms like GitHub, characterized by community engagement, active forums, and regular updates. Finally, we will draw conclusions about the potential of OH for industries beyond agriculture and healthcare, encouraging further innovation and collaboration in the open-source community.&lt;/p&gt;

        <subtitle>Oniro and OpenHarmony a cooperation to build a global ecosystem</subtitle>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;Global interoperability is probably the biggest problem that smart devices have been studied for more than 10 years. Multiple solutions have been proposed with different results, but none of them has established a reference framework and a global adoption. One of the main reasons for this to stay as a key element for research and investment is the diversity among the whole technology stack and geographical dispersion of device manufacturers. In the last years, there is a solution that is capturing the attention by demonstrating how an open source operating system can enable global interoperability in a huge domestic market like China. This solution is OpenHarmony and through a cooperation with Eclipse Foundation Oniro project, it is intended to use open source to drive interoperability and therefore solve one of the biggest challenges in the IoT and smart device industry. During the talk, it will be presented the approach followed by these two independent initiatives to cooperate while keeping the independence of the open source communities behind them.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>The SMART Box of AURA Project</title>
        <url>https://www.sfscon.it/talks/the-smart-box-of-aura-project/</url>
        <language/>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;AURA project centers on the development of &amp;#8220;Green &amp;amp; Smart Urban Furniture,&amp;#8221; a new generation of urban furniture that transcends traditional roles by incorporating eco-friendly and intelligent features. These urban elements are designed with bioabsorbent vegetation capable of mitigating atmospheric pollutants, making them environmentally sustainable. Furthermore, they are outfitted with advanced IoT sensors that monitor a range of environmental parameters, including climate data, urban pollution, and vehicular traffic.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These smart urban furniture units not only establish an extensive urban monitoring network but also actively combat pollution through the sequestration and reduction of harmful substances via the integrated vegetation. The embedded IoT sensors provide innovative capabilities for tracking the impact of these elements on the surrounding urban environment, such as monitoring air pollution levels and assessing the effects of heat islands. Each furniture piece is equipped with a &amp;#8220;smart box,&amp;#8221; a hardware system constructed using low-cost commercial off-the-shelf (COTS) components. This system includes climate and environmental sensors, gas measurement devices, a processing unit, and a data transmission module. The accompanying software, developed from scratch, delivers localized information—such as CO2 sequestration, temperature, and humidity—and contributes to a comprehensive environmental monitoring network aimed at predictive analysis, including weather risks, heat wave alerts, and health risks associated with air pollution. The presentation will delve into the custom-developed software and its ability to meet the field-level requirements of the AURA Architecture, encompassing individual sensors, sensor nodes (smart-boxes within the furniture), and the broader network of these nodes. It will highlight the significant impact and benefits of utilizing free and open-source technologies throughout the development process. Key focus areas include the creation of drivers for individual sensors, with emphasis on the most representative examples, the development of software for sensor nodes—covering features like self-testing, over-the-air (OTA) updates, and MQTT communication—and the design of a dynamic web app for data presentation, leveraging JavaScript, Bootstrap, and a JSON Data Lake. This comprehensive approach underscores the importance of open technologies in accelerating innovation, ensuring flexibility, and delivering robust, scalable solutions for smart urban environments.&lt;/p&gt;

        <language/>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;This talk will explore how Raspberry Pi and Node-RED enable robust solutions for automation and control systems in both industrial and local applications. Leveraging open-source technology, these platforms can handle a wide range of tasks, from reading sensor data and managing actuators, to controlling devices through industrial communication protocols such as Modbus, RS485 ascii RTU etc. Node-RED&amp;#8217;s message-driven architecture simplifies the creation of control logic, even for complex operations, while Raspberry Pi serves as a powerful and cost-effective alternative to traditional PLCs and IPCs. The integration of these tools allows for seamless data processing, remote communication, and the development of HMI interfaces both user-friendly or more traditiconal SCADA-like, making these technologies ideal for creating IIoT-native solutions. This presentation will focus on the technical capabilities, showing how these platforms can empower engineers and developers to build flexible and scalable automation solutions.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Approaches to Object Detection: Edge-Based and AI-Based</title>
        <url>https://www.sfscon.it/talks/approaches-to-object-detection-edge-based-and-ai-based/</url>
        <language/>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;This presentation explains why we passed to the expert system based on edge-based object detection on traditional image analysis techniques to the AI-based, leveraging advanced machine learning. The first method uses parameters derived from image analysis tools, focusing on attributes such as shape, size, and color of objects, informed by preliminary tests and expert data. The machine learning method employs a sophisticated algorithm that dynamically learns and identifies objects in images. We used both approaches using diverse datasets and measured their accuracy and efficiency under various conditions. The aim of this presentation is to show the improvement obtained by using the AI-based system applied for real-time detection and classification, offering insights into their practical strengths and applications.&lt;/p&gt;

        <description>&lt;p&gt;For a software engineer DRY is not only a washing machine progam, but it represents a deeply-held mantra: Don&amp;#8217;t Repeat Yourself.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To avoid repetitive manual work, automation tools like Ansible enable engineers to quickly configure infrastructure and easily deploy applications.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In this talk, we will explore the key concepts and benefits of Ansible for configuration management, deployment and orchestration of remote devices. We will start with an overview of Ansible&amp;#8217;s utility, how it works, and common use cases. We will see how YAML files describe configurations and playbooks define automated tasks and processes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Practical examples will show Ansible automation in action, including a quick introduction to initializing and keeping your operating system up to date by automating the installation and maintenance of system tools. We will also introduce the concept of dotfiles for configuration.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What are you waiting for? Learn how to spend 30 minutes automating 5-second tasks with Ansible! (It&amp;#8217;ll save you time in the long run, I promise!)&lt;/p&gt;

Almost every service you desire is available in &amp;#8220;the cloud&amp;#8221;.&lt;br /&gt;
At least some of your company&amp;#8217;s critical data is stored at some cloud provider.&lt;br /&gt;
Does your provider actually keep backups?&lt;br /&gt;
Can you live with their Recovery Time Objective (RTO)?&lt;br /&gt;
Do you believe they will actually meet the RTO?&lt;br /&gt;
Maybe you have another copy of your data?&lt;br /&gt;
In a format that you can actually access and read?&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Demystifying JWTs</title>
        <url>https://www.sfscon.it/talks/demystifying-jwts/</url>
        <language/>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;JSON Web Tokens (JWTs) have become a popular method for securely transmitting information between two parties. They are widely used in modern web applications for authentication and data exchange. However, their inner workings and security implications can be complex and often misunderstood by the developers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In this talk, we aim to demystify JWTs by exploring their structure, how they work, and the cryptographic mechanisms that ensure their integrity and confidentiality. We will discuss the components of a JWT, including headers, payloads, and signatures, and illustrate how they combine to form a token.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Furthermore, we will dive into best practices for JWT usage, common pitfalls to avoid, and security considerations such as token expiration, payload size, and the choice of cryptographic algorithms. Finally, we will explore how a WebSocket connection can be secured with JWTs. Security is increasingly an overlooked necessity while utilizing a protocol that does not support authentication by default.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;By the end of the session, attendees will have a clear understanding of how JWTs operate, their advantages over traditional session-based authentication, and how to implement them securely in their own applications.&lt;/p&gt;

        <description>&lt;p&gt;Containerization and micro-services change the way software is deployed and used in production contexts. Re-evaluation of the criteria for secure development and above all for secure configuration of these solutions. It would probably be appropriate to implement security already during the creation of the solution itself.&lt;/p&gt;

        <subtitle>Criminals and Govs are levereging Open Source tools, libraries and software to break into organizations. Let's stop 'em.</subtitle>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;There is a prevalent myth that open source software is inherently secure. However, this is not true. Open source software is susceptible to vulnerabilities just like any other software. Moreover, the fact that anyone can review the code does not guarantee that the right people will do so. Open source software faces two important threats than not everybody are aware of:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Vulnerabilities: Open source developers need to understand and communicate the security posture of their projects to users. They must adopt robust security practices. The Log4j incident in 2021, which led to the Log4Shell vulnerability, triggered a catastrophic wave of attacks due to inadequate support for the logging framework and its critical role in company procedures.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Dev teams infiltration: Criminal organizations and government hacking teams are executing highly sophisticated social engineering operations to infiltrate understaffed open source projects. Their goal is to compromise development teams and insert backdoors into the software. The most recent attack on a significant project was discovered in April 2024.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Objective of the Talk: Inform the community about these two security scenarios and demonstrate how to effectively address them.&lt;/p&gt;

        <description>&lt;p&gt;Description: Fuji is a free software, licensed under GPL v3, that leverages Apple Software Restore (ASR) and Rsync to create forensic images of macOS systems. It operates on logged-in computers to efficiently capture disk images while maintaining data integrity.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Bypassing encryption on Apple silicon processors presents significant challenges due to their advanced hardware encryption mechanisms and secure enclave protections. These processors employ complex security protocols that safeguard data at a hardware level, making unauthorized access and decryption extremely difficult. Without proper authentication or specific exploits, forensic imaging on these devices requires substantial technical expertise and often necessitates the cooperation of the device owner.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We&amp;#8217;ll see how to acquire forensically MacBook data with free software&lt;/p&gt;

        <description>&lt;p&gt;As AI apps become mainstream, conventional IT wisdoms apply. AI apps must be no monoliths, but need to be logged, audited, and overall well integrated into normal IT. This means all AI data – vectors, input, output – is best stored in a normal RDBMS. Better still: In an open source database with performance, stability, and ease of use. Here is an overview of the AI opportunities, possibilities, methodologies, and features in MariaDB Server.&lt;/p&gt;

        <description>&lt;p&gt;Doc Kit is an open source command line tool that automates the creation of software documentation and release notes.&lt;br /&gt;
It can be used in conjunction with DocBook Authoring and Publishing Suite (DAPS) for quickly preparing the skeleton of professional looking software documentation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Doc Kit has been designed for initialising SUSE or openSUSE documentation repositories but in a few steps it can be re-used for other projects too.&lt;br /&gt;
The tool consists of two parts:&lt;br /&gt;
1. a command-line tool called doc-kit that can download documentation boilerplate files&lt;br /&gt;
2. a repository of documentation boilerplate files, such as the SUSE/openSUSE book preface and entity files.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The presentation will show how to use Doc Kit and how to customise the provided templates for creating a brand new documentation or release notes projects.&lt;/p&gt;

        <description>&lt;p&gt;This presentation focuses on the open-source project codEEmoji, an IDE plugin that adds additional information to the code through emojis. The talk starts by discussing the benefits of this approach compared to other ways to present information for the developer in IDEs. It follows by presenting the plugin and its main functionalities, which go from pointing out bad practices in method and variable naming to presenting modifiers and method characteristics in their usage. Next, it is presented how the plugin structure was designed to receive new contributions. The talk finishes by presenting some challenges and future features.&lt;/p&gt;

        <language/>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;Migration from monolithic systems to microservices has earned significant interest in recent years. Software architects and developers welcome approaches, techniques, and patterns that can facilitate and automate the migration process. This talk will present Monolith Splitter, a tool that employs various approaches for splitting a monolith into a microservices architecture. This tool could be beneficial for software architects looking to migrate monolithic projects to a more scalable architecture. It uses execution traces to analyze monolithic software and suggests which classes should be grouped together in separate services according to criteria such as cohesion, modularity, and independence of evolvability. We will showcase the application of the tool to a series of open source software projects, discussing the outcomes, the benefits, and the current limitations.&lt;/p&gt;

        <subtitle>Going beyond measuring workload and performance</subtitle>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;In Microservices, measuring workload and performance are old news! They&amp;#8217;re still important, but we can do more. In this talk, we&amp;#8217;re navigating through new ideas on how to use metrics to tell us more than the basics about our microservices. Did you know we can evaluate our microservices in the architectural level? So we&amp;#8217;ll have concrete data to support our decision-making. Between patterns and bad smells, we can use metrics to detect the points where they happen. Let&amp;#8217;s explore these new possibilities to improve our experience when evolving a microservice system, towards a more robust and maintainable direction! Bonus: you&amp;#8217;ll learn about an open-source tool to facilitate this process, of which I&amp;#8217;m a maintainer, and you could be too!&lt;/p&gt;

        <description>&lt;p&gt;Over the past 6 months I&amp;#8217;ve been working on improving notifications for the GNU/Linux desktop. This includes a new version of the xdg-desktop-portal notification spec, improved notification UI in GNOME Shell, and various backend components (e.g. GLib and portals).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In this talk I&amp;#8217;ll explain why it was so difficult, how we untangled it, and what&amp;#8217;s in store for the future.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Sync Your Tunes, Sync Your Screen: Introducing SyncWall</title>
        <url>https://www.sfscon.it/talks/sync-your-tunes-sync-your-screen-introducing-syncwall/</url>
        <language/>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;Ever wished your computer could visually represent your playlist? SyncWall lets you turn every song into a unique visual experience, by dynamically matching your desktop wallpaper to the music currently playing on Spotify!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We&amp;#8217;ll demonstrate SyncWall in action, showcasing its capabilities, and then we&amp;#8217;ll dive deeper into the code and the process of creating the images.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;SyncWall relies on two core components: Spotify&amp;#8217;s API, which provides with all the necessary song information, and Python&amp;#8217;s PIL library, which allows to easily manipulate images. Throughout the presentation, we will explore the key concepts and most useful functions of these two technologies, providing you with practical tools to integrate into your own projects.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Even if Syncwall is designed for GNOME, we will dive deep on how to make it work also in different desktop environments. This will cover all the steps and the challenges involved.&lt;/p&gt;

        <subtitle>Empower non-professional developers to drive innovation!</subtitle>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;In a world where proprietary no-code platforms with vendor lock-in and opacity dominate, there is a crucial need to enhance the developer experience of open source applications, libraries, and tools.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We will explore how we can make open source software more accessible to citizen developers and non-professional programmers who face significant barriers to entry with modern open source tools. Showing the importance of collaborating with these developers, who are often closer to real-world problems, to improve the quality and usability of open source software.&lt;/p&gt;

        <subtitle>A Minetest story</subtitle>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;Videogames are part of our daily life. They allow us to unplug, to relax, to compete, simulating a reality that puts us at the centre of a new digital world. However, if we go deeper into the way videogames are made, we&amp;#8217;ll learn that their market can be brutal and the ethics of their business models highly debatable &amp;#8211; if not plain unbearable. Nowadays, playing a videogame usually means renouncing to our privacy and shaking hands with realities that we might not tolerate if we knew what they conceal. It was during the pandemic that a Minetest server called AES was born. Made by volunteers, AES decided to go against that: to build an online space where to play without strings attached. A place where everyone can have fun and nothing is proprietary. Four years later, this is its story.&lt;/p&gt;

        <description>&lt;p&gt;In this workshop we will dive into the possibilities of encouraging women*, especially girls, to thinker and to code. With tools such as the Free Software Foundation Europe’s (FSFE) illustrated book &amp;#8220;Ada &amp;amp; Zangemann &amp;#8211; A Tale of Software, Skateboards, and Raspberry Ice Cream&amp;#8221;everybody can create ways to spark the participation of women* and girls in tech.The book tells the story of Ada, a girl who loves to experiment with hardware and software. Ada realises how crucial it is to control technology and decides to stand up to the mighty inventor Zangemann.This workshop will also intend to explore ways to promote diversity and gender equity in the Free Software community and beyond. Together we will identify the challenges women* face in participating in such communities and discuss how we can create more inclusive environments, especially for the future generations.We encourage you to join us to share your experiences, ideas and perspectives, and collaborate in creating a more inclusive and diverse future in the Free Software community for all.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Knitting Our Internet workshop</title>
        <language/>
        <abstract>An interactive journey through the history of the Internet, and how to save it, together</abstract>
        <subtitle>An interactive journey through the history of the Internet, and how to save it, together</subtitle>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;“Knitting Our Internet” (KOI) is a workshop that explores the history of the Internet, and offers a perspective for a collective re-imagination of participatory, decentralized networks.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The workshop aims at questioning the very essence of today’s social media, exposing the critical limits posed by centralization, monopoly, and surveillance capitalism.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;KOI was conceived in June 2023 by &lt;a href="https://tommi.space"&gt;Tommaso Marmo&lt;/a&gt;, who was looking for a simple yet critical and accurate way to introduce the concept of the Fediverse to non-experts.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The content and structure of the workshop matured over time, as it adapted to very diverse audiences of any ages and backgrounds. Furthermore, the experience is based on Tommaso’s academic research, mainly conducted for “&lt;a href="https://tommi.space/csss/"&gt;Computer Sciences are Social Sciences&lt;/a&gt;”, his bachelor’s thesis.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Content&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;During the activity, Tommaso will be using a yarn his grandmother gifted him to simulate centralized and decentralized networks, employing concrete metaphors to actively involve the participants. Every individual attending the workshop will be given a quote or an image relevant in the early and contemporary history of the Internet, and they will be asked to share it as the story unfolds.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Allowing them to understand the essential challenges society faces in relation to technological advancement, participants will be empowered to get involved in the Fediverse, especially understanding the importance of decentralization, Free Software, and the political role played by technical tools.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Notes&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Given its malleable and open structure, the content of the workshop can be adapted, enriched, and edited to match the key topics of SFSCON 2024 in the best possible way.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The interactive parts of the workshop can be limited and a more theoretical presentation, diving in the thoughts of philosophers and computer sciences, could be added, too.&lt;/p&gt;

        <subtitle>An introduction to the decentralised social network</subtitle>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;The Fediverse is a decentralised social network. But what does that mean?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In this talk I will give a short introduction to the Fediverse of 2024 and how it started to evolve in 2008. I will explain the basic concepts of ActivityPub as the protocol of the Fediverse and how the use of this open protocol has enabled a diverse group of Free Software projects to build a social network of (micro) blogging, video streaming, podcasting and event organising. A network where users can share and interact with each other regardless of the platform they use. What will be possible in the Fediverse of 2024? And how can you get started today?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This talk does not require any technical knowledge of the Fediverse. However, you should know what an email is.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>How to build a website for the IndieWeb</title>
        <url>https://www.sfscon.it/talks/how-to-build-a-website-for-the-indieweb/</url>
        <language/>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;Have you ever heard of terms like POSSE, syndication, or webmention?&lt;br /&gt;
What about protocols like Web Sign-In or Micropub?&lt;br /&gt;
These terms are all connected to the IndieWeb, a community of websites built on open standards and open source technologies.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In today&amp;#8217;s digital age, our online content and identities are more important than ever. Relying on random companies and social networks to manage them isn&amp;#8217;t ideal. Instead, we should take control of our online presence by building our own website for the IndieWeb.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In this talk, you&amp;#8217;ll learn how to:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;1. Publish content on your website via a Micropub server.&lt;br /&gt;
2. Syndicate that content elsewhere (i.e., republish it on another website).&lt;br /&gt;
3. Gather comments from social networks and display them on your website.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We will achieve all of this using a static website and a few open-source tools.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>ARM Linux Laptops for Developers Status Report</title>
        <url>https://www.sfscon.it/talks/arm-linux-laptops-for-developers-status-report/</url>
        <language/>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;Intrigued by 22+ hours of battery life with comparable performance to current Intel / AMD systems? Starting from June this year a bunch of new ARM based laptops have been launched. All major laptop vendors launched devices, with over 33 to choose from at the time of this writing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While ARM based laptops have been available for years, they mostly have been targeted as cheap entry level ChromeBooks or MacBooks designed for MacOS only. Luckily with this new wave of ARM based laptops there should be something for everybody.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The core question is how well they behave under Linux. Being designed for&lt;br /&gt;
Windows-on-ARM there is a risk Linux support is rudimentary at best. Stefan set out to test this and is reporting back here. Does a boot with UEFI work out of the box? Are all hardware features supported? Is the firmware for various drivers available? How is the performance?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And the most important question: how does it stack up against an Intel based laptop from the same timeframe as daily driver for software development?&lt;/p&gt;

        <language/>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;In this talk, we&amp;#8217;ll focus on how the AlmaLinux project has chosen to foster a positive, drama-free community in the Linux ecosystem.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;#8212;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Whether you&amp;#8217;re starting a new community or wrangling an existing one, it can be tempting to fall into the trap of bonding over shared enemies to see short-term, high-numbers growth. But, benny has spent the last 10 years building drama-free communities with a different kind of success.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While many open-source projects rally members through shared frustrations or negativity, AlmaLinux took the more challenging path of uniting people through thoughtful dialogue and focusing on helping each other. By prioritizing respect, collaboration, and inclusivity, the AlmaLinux community grew healthier and stronger without the need for battle cries or infusing drama. Learn how this approach not only built a stable and thriving community around AlmaLinux, but is also setting a new standard for open-source communities &amp;#8211; and proving that progress doesn’t have to be divisive.&lt;/p&gt;
